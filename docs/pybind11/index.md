# Pybind11: Python ü§ù C++

Welcome to the NextCV development guide. Here, we'll show you how to make your Python code **blazing fast** when it matters.

## üéØ The Philosophy: Smart Performance

!!! quote "Our Approach"
    We don't rewrite everything in C++. That would be like using a Formula 1 car to go to the grocery store. Instead, we're pragmatic.

We follow a simple, three-step process:

1.  **Prototype in Python:** Build and test your ideas quickly.
2.  **Identify Bottlenecks:** Find the parts of your code that are *actually* slow.
3.  **Optimize with C++:** Rewrite only the critical parts for maximum impact.

This gives us the best of both worlds:

| Feature | Python :snake: | C++ :zap: |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Speed** | Fast Prototyping | Raw Performance |
| **Usage** | General Purpose | Critical Bottlenecks |
| **Ecosystem** | Rich & Extensive | Focused & Performant |

!!! success "Key Insight"
    We're not performance-obsessed, we're **value-obsessed**. We only add C++ when it provides a real, measurable benefit.
