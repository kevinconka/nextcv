# PyBind11 Development Guide

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the NextCV development guide where we're going to make your Python code absolutely **blazing fast** when it actually matters. Think of this as your roadmap to building computer vision tools that are both easy to use AND lightning quick.

## ðŸŽ¯ The NextCV Philosophy: Smart Performance, Not Just Fast Performance

!!! quote "Our Approach"
    Here's the thing - we're not trying to rewrite the entire Python ecosystem in C++. That would be like using a Formula 1 car to go to the grocery store.

Instead, we follow a much smarter approach:

=== "Python for Prototyping :snake:"
    - **Quick iteration**: Perfect for rapid development and testing
    - **Familiar ecosystem**: Leverage existing Python libraries
    - **Easy debugging**: Use standard Python tools
    - **Great for MVPs**: Get features working fast

=== "C++ for Performance :zap:"
    - **Optimized code**: When Python hits performance limits
    - **Memory control**: Fine-grained memory management
    - **SIMD/Threading**: Hardware-level optimizations
    - **Real bottlenecks**: Solve actual performance issues

=== "C++ Standalone Ready :package:"
    - **Header-only**: Easy to include in C++ projects
    - **No Python deps**: Works without Python runtime
    - **Clean APIs**: Well-documented C++ interfaces
    - **Modern C++**: Using C++17 features

=== "Best of Both :rocket:"
    - **Gradual optimization**: Start Python, optimize later
    - **Mixed usage**: Use each language's strengths
    - **Flexible deployment**: Run anywhere needed
    - **Future-proof**: Scale as requirements grow

!!! success "Key Insight"
    We're not performance-obsessed, we're **value-obsessed**. We only add C++ when it actually solves a real problem.
