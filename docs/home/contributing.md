# Contributing to NextCV

First off, thank you for considering contributing to NextCV! We welcome all contributions, from bug fixes to new features and documentation improvements.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

!!! tip "Quick Setup"
We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as our package manager - it's like pip, but much faster! Learn more in the [uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#readme).

We recommend following this workflow to contribute:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a feature branch:** `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3.  **Install development dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Install uv (if you don't have it)
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # Install clang-format (for C++ code formatting)
    # macOS: brew install clang-format
    # Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install clang-format
    ```

4.  **Set up the development environment:**

    ```bash
    # Install dependencies with uv (blazing fast Python package manager)
    uv sync

    # Install pre-commit hooks
    uvx pre-commit install
    ```

5.  **Make your changes:** Write your code and add tests for it.
6.  **Run tests and code quality checks:**

    ```bash
    # Run tests
    uv run pytest

    # Run pre-commit checks
    uvx pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

7.  **Commit your changes:** `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
8.  **Push to your branch:** `git push origin my-new-feature`
9.  **Submit a pull request:** Open a pull request from your fork to the main NextCV repository.
