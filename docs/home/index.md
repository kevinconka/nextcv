!!! abstract "Our Philosophy: Pragmatic Performance"

    We believe in a simple but powerful idea: **use Python for everything, until it's not fast enough.** Then, and only then, do we bring in C++ to optimize the bottlenecks.

    - **🐍 Python First:** Rapid prototyping and development.
    - **🚀 C++ for Speed:** When performance is critical.
    - **🎯 Strategic Optimization:** We don't rewrite everything, just what matters.

## ☕️ Buy Me a Coffee

Primpting AI agents is hard! Coffees are needed when AI agents derail so much I actually have to write code.
